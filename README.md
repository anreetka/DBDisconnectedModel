## Overview

### ADO.NET Disconnected Model

The ADO.NET Disconnected Model allows applications to interact with a database without maintaining an ongoing connection. This is achieved by using objects like `DataSet` and `DataTable` that store data in memory. The Disconnected Model is useful in scenarios where:

- The application needs to work with data offline or when network connections are intermittent.
- Performance can be improved by reducing the number of database round-trips.
- Batch operations can be performed on data without requiring a constant connection to the database.

## Features

- Easy management of disconnected data models
- Integration with ADO.NET for robust data operations
- Supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Flexible and easy-to-integrate with .NET applications

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher
- ADO.NET libraries
